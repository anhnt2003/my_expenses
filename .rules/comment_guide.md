- Use comments sparingly, and when you do, make them meaningful.
- All comments MUST use block-style opening and closing brackets: /* comment */.
- Do NOT use single-line comment syntax such as // or #.
- Don't comment on obvious things. Excessive, redundant, or unclear comments clutter the codebase and quickly become outdated.
- Use comments to explain the "why" behind decisions, not to restate what the code is doing.
- Use comments to document unusual behavior, edge cases, workarounds, and potential pitfalls.
- Ensure comments are kept up to date when the related code changes.
- If the language does not support /* */ comments, do not add comments.
